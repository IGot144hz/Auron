Discord bridge to integrate Auron with Discord servers.

This bot listens for messages, routes them through the assistant controller and
relays responses back to Discord.  Voice support is optional and can be
enabled via configuration.  The implementation uses the ``discord.py``
library and runs in its own asynchronous event loop.
